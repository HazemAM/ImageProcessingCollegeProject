MATLAB Builder NE (.NET Component)


1. Prerequisites for Deployment 

. Verify the MATLAB Compiler Runtime (MCR) is installed and ensure you    
  have installed version 8.0 (R2012b).   

. If the MCR is not installed, do the following:
  (1) enter
  
      >>mcrinstaller
      
      at MATLAB prompt. The MCRINSTALLER command displays the 
      location of the MCR Installer.

  (2) run the MCR Installer.

Or download the Windows 64-bit version of the MCR for R2012b 
from the MathWorks Web site by navigating to

   http://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/mcr/index.html
   

For more information about the MCR and the MCR Installer, see 
Distribution to End Users in the MATLAB Compiler documentation  
in the MathWorks Documentation Center.  
      
NOTE: You will need administrator rights to run MCRInstaller.

2. Files to Deploy and Package

-LHEQ.dll
   -contains the generated component using MWArray API. 
-LHEQNative.dll
   -contains the generated component using native API.
-This readme file

. If the target machine does not have the version 8.0 of the MCR installed, and the end 
  users are unable to download the MCR using the above link, include MCRInstaller.exe.



Auto-generated Documentation Templates:

MWArray.xml - This file contains the code comments for the MWArray data conversion 
              classes and their methods. This file can be found in either the component 
              distrib directory or in
              <mcr_root>*\toolbox\dotnetbuilder\bin\win64\v2.0

LHEQ_overview.html - HTML overview documentation file for the generated component. It 
                     contains the requirements for accessing the component and for 
                     generating arguments using the MWArray class hierarchy.

LHEQ.xml - This file contains the code comments for the LHEQ component classes and 
                     methods. Using a third party documentation tool, this file can be 
                     combined with either or both of the previous files to generate 
                     online documentation for the LHEQ component.
